           Windows-based Reverse Engineering Toolkit "All-In-One"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS REVENS?

ReVens is a Windows-based Reverse Engineering Toolkit "All-In-One", built for 
security purposes (malware analysis, penetration testing) and educational use 
only. It serves as a comprehensive package manager for reverse engineering tools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            LEGAL & ETHICAL NOTICE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Respecting the rights of software developers is paramount. Engaging in activities 
such as bypassing software protections or reverse engineering software without 
explicit permission is not only generally illegal, but also unethical. It's 
essential to utilize software in the manner intended by its creators and in 
compliance with the stipulated terms of service or license agreement.

By using ReVens, you agree to use this toolkit solely for:
  - Authorized security research and penetration testing
  - Malware analysis in controlled environments
  - Educational and learning purposes
  - Legal reverse engineering activities with proper authorization

Any misuse of this toolkit for illegal activities is strictly prohibited and 
solely the responsibility of the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNINGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ANTIVIRUS DETECTION:
Reverse engineering tools are often flagged by antivirus software due to their 
use of binary patching algorithms, debugging techniques, packing, unpacking, and 
similar operations that resemble malware behavior. This is expected and does not 
indicate actual malicious content.

- RECOMMENDED USAGE ENVIRONMENT:
It is strongly recommended to use ReVens in a secure virtual machine or sandbox 
environment to ensure system safety and proper isolation from your main operating 
system.

- TRUSTED SOURCES:
ReVens packages are automatically downloaded from trusted and verified sources. 
However, users should always exercise caution and verify the integrity of 
downloaded tools.

- PACKAGE SAFETY:
Not all packages (items) included in ReVens are guaranteed to be safe. Some tools 
may contain experimental features, aggressive behavior, or potentially unwanted 
modifications. Always use packages with caution, preferably in an isolated 
environment, and understand what each tool does before executing it.

The name ReVens originates from "(R)(e)(v)(e)r(s)e E(n)gineering", reflecting 
its core purpose as a toolkit centered around software reverse-engineering. 
The project traces its roots back to an unpublished project from around 2010 
known as FutureComp, by FCG-Team. That early version was built with 
AutoPlay Media Studio 6.0 (AMS 6.0), but the original project source files were 
completely lost, leaving only fragments of its design and concept behind.

Between 2006 and 2010, the creator, Jakiboy, was heavily involved in using 
several all-in-one reverse-engineering tool distributions of the era. 
Notable influences included "CRACKL@B DVD" (2006) published by eXelab, 
as well as "Cracking Kit 2010" (released in 2008), which utilized the PStart 
launcher menu. 

These early tool collections shaped the vision for what would 
eventually evolve into ReVens—aiming to modernize, streamline, 
and rebuild the kind of organized RE environment those classic kits provided, 
but with a cleaner, more up-to-date launcher and packages manager.
